				visit to Notout11.com. These third-party advertisers might use the user information (excluding personal
				details like name, address, phone number etc.) for analyzing and tracking the user visits to this and
				other websites, in order to understand the user interests, and then provide goods, services and other
				advertisements on the basis of user interests. Notout11 shall not reveal, share or disclose the personal
				information or the identity of the user collected at the time of registration with these third-party
				advertisers. Several fraudulent emails, websites, blogs etc. often including the photos, logos, links,

				debit card details of the user by convincing the users that they have won any winnings or bonus amounts.

			</p>
			<h3>USE OF COOKIES</h3>
			<p>To improve the effectiveness and usability of the Portal for our Users, we use "cookies", or such similar
				electronic tools to collect information to assign each visitor a unique random number as a User
				Identification (User ID) to understand the User's individual interests using the identified computer.
				Unless the User voluntarily identifies himself/herself (e.g., through registration), Notout11 has no way
				of knowing who the User is, even if we assign a cookie to the User's computer. The only personal
				information a cookie can contain is information supplied by the User. A cookie cannot read data off the
				User's hard drive. Notout11 advertisers may also assign their own cookies to the User's browser (if the
				User clicks on their ad banners), a process that Notout11 does not control. <br>
				Notout11 web servers automatically collect limited information about User's computer's connection to the
				Internet, including User's IP address, when the User visits the Portal. (User's IP address is a number
				that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send data to the User -- such as the web
				pages viewed by the User). The User's IP address does not identify the User personally. Notout11 uses
				this information to deliver its web pages to Users upon request, to tailor its Portal to the interests
				of its users, to measure traffic within the Portal and let advertisers know the geographic locations
				from where Notout11 visitors come. <br> <br>
			</p>
			<h3>Information Security:</h3>
			<p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized
				alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection,
				storage and processing practices and security measures, including appropriate encryption and physical
				security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. Notout11
				has a comprehensive information security program and information security policies which contain
				managerial, technical, operational and physical security control measures adopted by Notout11 for the
				protection of Sensitive Personal Date and Other Personal Information. <br>
				<br>
				Information gathered by Notout11 is stored securely using several information security applications
				including firewalls. However, security is always relative and Notout11 cannot guarantee that its
				security measures are absolute and cannot be breached. Data which is transmitted over the Internet is
				inherently exposed to security risks or threats. For instance, information transmitted via chat or share
				any information with them. <br>
				<br>
				Notout11strongly recommends the users not to trust, and respond to such mails, blogs, websites etc. and
				also not to share any credit /debit card details with them. <br>
				Any doubts or comments with respect to this Refund & Cancellation Policy can be sent to Notout11.com at
				godlinegaming85@gmail.com. <br> <br> <br>
